___
In this project, I assume the role of an analyst at a Proptech (Proptech is the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry) company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets. is to build a tool.

My role during this project is to utilize my data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

As such, I will create a Jupyter notebook that contains my analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.
